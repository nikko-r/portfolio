# old portfolio

From the start I focussed on not so much completing the project but more to display what I learned and new skills I picked up.

I wanted to make my code as clean as posible using what I learned with BEM. I also wanted to make my HTML as clean as possible to read which made me struggle with time as I had to do everything through CSS.
One of the biggest challenges I went through with CSS was sizing which affected mostly positioning of elements as I avoided using DIV elements as much as possible to keep my HTML code as clean as possible. This made it tricky as I quickly learned because without those DIV elements, changing 1 size value changed the positioning of everything.

I stuck to making my code work with all screen sizes by using flex and wanted to avoid using @media screen as much as posible.

What I learned from this task is that using some DIV elements is not bad and helps us to correctly position elements but using too many should be avoided. BEM is very usefull and helpfull when trying to search for which classes are related to each other. What I need to do is to also practice seperacing out my scss files.

# new portfolio

Looking back at my old portfolio I decided to use my previous skills as a UI/UX designer to make
my portfolio look professional at the same time as clean and a good design.

I had more time to complete it as I completed the \_nology course and so i got to work designing
the new portfolio on Figma. Once i had a base design I got to coding the website making sure
I kept the theme consistant throughout.
